*Project Goal*:

The goal of this project is to use unsupervised learning algorithms in this case its K-Means clustering for finding a replacement in case of injury for a player.The dataset is from Indian Premier League and the player we have taken in this case is Virat Kohli. 

*Motivation:*

Cricket being my favorite sport has always fascinated me and being a data scientist it is always fun to play with new datasets. Being in team management it is always necessary to analysis the teams performance and in this case if there is an injury the team needs to find a player replacement.

*Methods Applied*

The algorithm applied in this project is K Means Clustering.

Using Pipepline and Grid Search for better parameters.

*Data Summary:*

The data set if of Indian Premier League which is from 2008 to 2016. It contains different player ids and their names and Ball by Ball statistics of these players. There are three different datasets we have used which are Match.csv, Player.csv and ball_by_ball.csv. The ballbyball.csv has 136590 rows and 6 columns.
